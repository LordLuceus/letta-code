/**
 * Applies the cross-agent filesystem sandbox to an agent process's shell
 * commands at spawn. The whole shell — and anything it forks — runs under a
 * kernel policy that denies reading or writing other agents' memory while
 * leaving the current agent's own directory, the repo, and temp writable.
 *
 * Shared by every shell executor — the `Bash` tool (`bash.ts`), the Codex
 * `exec_command`/`write_stdin` sessions (`exec-command.ts`), and the Gemini
 * `run_shell_command` path (`shell.ts`) — so the kernel owns the whole shell
 * surface, not just one dialect.
 *
 * This is the SOLE cross-agent enforcement for spawned shells: the static
 * cross-agent guard no longer analyzes shell commands (it was bypassable by
 * symlinks, command substitution, globbing, and subprocesses). The kernel
 * resolves real paths regardless of how the command spelled them.
 *
 * OFF by default; set `LETTA_FS_SANDBOX=1` to opt in (recommended for
 * multi-tenant deployments where agents must not read each other's memory).
 * No-ops when the host has no sandbox backend.
