/**
 * Policy for the memory-subagent launch profile: it may read the filesystem broadly to do

 *
 * The whole subagent process runs under this policy, so it is the sole
 * enforcement for these agents — the static guard is skipped for them. It covers
 * both axes:
 *   - writes: `restrictWrites` denies writes everywhere except the base
 *     `~/.letta` carve (and self memory). This scopes the agent's
 *     non-deterministic work — it can persist memory + harness metadata
 *     (settings, logs, conversations, transcripts) but cannot write the repo,
 *     home, or temp. Carving the WHOLE `~/.letta` rather than enumerating each
 *     harness file is deliberate: the harness writes many paths under it and the
 *     set is unbounded, so a per-file carve would silently break as new writers
 *     appear. The cross-agent tree nested inside `~/.letta` stays denied.
 *   - cross-agent reads: the agents tree is read+write denied, with the agent's
 *     own (and inherited parent's) directory carved back out READ-only.
 *
 * Carving the whole agent *directory* readable — not just `/memory` — is what
 * lets us deny the tree without re-triggering the empty-env bug: the subagent's
 * cwd is its memory dir inside the agents tree, and under Seatbelt a child
 * launches with an EMPTY environment if a cwd *ancestor* is read-denied. With
 * the agent dir (the cwd's immediate parent) readable, process init can traverse
 * to the cwd and the env survives.
 *
 * Both backend trees are denied by default so cloud/API agents cannot read local
 * agent memories and local agents cannot read cloud/API memories. Self memory is
 * re-carved writable in `writableRoots` because it is nested inside a denied
 * tree (the base `~/.letta` carve is overridden there by the deny).
