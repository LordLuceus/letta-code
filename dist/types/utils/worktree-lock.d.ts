/**
 * Cross-agent advisory lock so two conversations do not both switch into the
 * same worktree and clobber each other's uncommitted work. The lock is a small
 * JSON file written into the worktree's per-worktree git admin directory
 * (`<common>/worktrees/<name>/`), which keeps it out of the working tree and
 * lets `git worktree remove` clean it up automatically.
 *
 * This module is the pure file-backed primitive (acquire/release plus ownership
 * and liveness rules). The session-aware orchestration that resolves git dirs
 * and reads the runtime context lives with the worktree tool.
